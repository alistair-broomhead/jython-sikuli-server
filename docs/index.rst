Welcome to the jython-sikuli-server documentation
=================================================

The recommeneded way to get hold of jython-sikuli-server is to install as a
python package, using `pip install jython-sikuli-server`, which will allow you
to upgrade using `pip install jython-sikuli-server -U`. This will install and
update the jython code itself, as well as two scripts - sikuliserver.bat for
windows and sikuliserver.sh for any others.

These scripts can be uesd to run the server on your system under test, however
you will need Java 6 and Sikuli X installed on your machine, in the paths
referred to by those scripts - please get in contact if you need help getting
sikuli server up and running.

For help installing Java 6 see http://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml

For Sikuli X please see http://www.sikuli.org/download.html
